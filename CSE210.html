            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>
                This course is an extension of the previous Computer Programming I. In
                Computer Programming II, students will take what they learned previously
                and extend it into more advanced concepts and program design. The main
                focuses and projects in this class will center on the advancements and
                intricacies of programming classes in Object-Oriented Programming. Projects
                for CSE-210 are conceptual but focus on separating a larger whole into
                several smaller parts, such as having a class for baseball, football,
                basketball, etc. all under the larger class umbrella of sports.
