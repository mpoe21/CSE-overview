            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>
                In Human Computer Interaction, students will learn about how to
                make computer applications appeal to the user. The course will
                cover how to work with the UI (User Interface) in order to make
                programs interesting and entertaining. Students will be given
                projects with basic functions and will be asked to extend these
                samples to make them much more interesting and will add features
                to make them apply to more audiences. Some projects covered in
                this course were a door game, tic tac toe, a counter, a calculator,
                and a memory game.
