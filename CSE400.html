            <p>
                Cybersecurity is one of the most important and pertinent fields in
                computer science. As people rely more on computers and technology
                as a whole, there are hackers who take advantage of the lack of
                available knowledge and security in these systems. It is more and
                more important to secure these systems and ensure the safety of all
                users. In this class, students will learn about many common attacks
                among hackers and the best ways to counteract these attacks. They
                will learn the importance of keeping data safe and what can happen
                if user data is not kept safe.
