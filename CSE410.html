            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>
                The age of technology has left the desk and is now all mobile. Everyone
                now has a cell phone, tablet, or mobile gaming device. Web and mobile
                applications must be designed in a way that will make the most sense
                for these mobile devices. In Mobile Computing, students will learn how
                to make these applications specific to the mobile devices and systems
                that they would run on. The main program used in this class will be
                React Native, which uses modified JavaScript in order to create these
                applications to run on web, Android, and IOS systems.
