            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>
                In Emerging Technologies, lectures will focus on the newest trends in
                computer science and technology. As one of the most growing career
                fields on Earth, computer science and the knowledge out there on it are
                always growing and changing. Currently, Emerging Technologies is focusing
                on Deep Learning Models. ChatGPT has revolutionized the field and the
                technology has become more common, so all computer science professionals
                need to have a relatively good idea of how machine learning works. The
                course involves learning about the math and algorithms of the models, what
                makes a model effective, and how to change hyperparameters in order to make
                the optimal model.
