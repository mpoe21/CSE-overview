            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>
                In Capstone, students will build a comprehensive, 16-week project.
                They will form a problem, chart a course to solve the problem, and
                use all of the information that they have learned in the last four
                years. Over the course of the semester, they will flesh out a fully
                functional project and deliver a complete solution to the problem.
                While the students are working on their projects, the lectures will
                focus on some emerging trends in the industry. Right now, the students
                are gaining extra information on Data Mining and how important that is
                to the industry.
